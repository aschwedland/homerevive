        Frequently Asked Questions
    </h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
        <div class="faq-list">
            <div class="faq faq-item fade-up">
                <h5 class="faq-title">
                    How do I know when it’s time to repaint the interior of my home? <span class="faq-chevron"><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></span>
                </h5>
                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        You’ll know it’s time to repaint the interior of your home when you start noticing certain signs of wear and tear. Common indicators include fading paint, cracked or peeling paint, and stains or discoloration that regular cleaning can’t remove. If you see these issues, it’s often a sign that your walls need fresh paint for both aesthetic appeal and protection.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        In addition to visual cues, it might be time for a repaint if you’re updating your home’s style or switching up your interior décor. New paint colors can give your rooms a completely refreshed look and feel, matching your evolving tastes or design trends. Other practical reasons include preparing your home for sale—fresh, neutral colors can boost property value and appeal to potential buyers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        Finally, rooms with higher traffic, like kitchens, hallways, and kids' rooms, tend to need more frequent painting due to scuffs, marks, and wall damage. On average, experts recommend repainting every 5-7 years, depending on usage, lighting conditions, and the quality of the previous paint job. If you’re seeing any of these signs, it’s a great time to consult with professional interior painters to refresh your living space.

                    What are the benefits of remodeling a kitchen versus a bathroom in Denver homes? <span class="faq-chevron"><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></span>
                </h5>
                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        When deciding between remodeling a kitchen or bathroom in your Denver home, both offer unique benefits. Kitchen remodels typically deliver a higher return on investment, as this space is often the heart of the home. An updated kitchen can enhance functionality, improve energy efficiency with modern appliances, and make your home more appealing to potential buyers. Open floor plans, new countertops, and cabinetry can also greatly increase the value and aesthetic appeal of your property.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        On the other hand, a bathroom remodel can improve daily comfort and address important issues like outdated plumbing or water efficiency. Upgrading your bathroom with modern fixtures, new tile, or even adding a second bathroom can increase the functionality of your home and create a more luxurious, spa-like atmosphere. This can be especially beneficial in homes with fewer bathrooms, as adding an extra bathroom significantly boosts market value. Ultimately, both kitchen and bathroom remodels can improve your home's value, efficiency, and overall appeal, but the choice depends on your current needs and budget.
