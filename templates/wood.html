                <h5 class="faq-title">
                    What’s the best type of wood flooring for Colorado’s climate? <span class="faq-chevron"><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></span>
                </h5>
                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        For Colorado’s climate, which can be dry with fluctuating temperatures, the best type of wood flooring is engineered hardwood. Unlike solid hardwood, engineered wood is designed to withstand changes in humidity and temperature, making it more resistant to warping, expanding, or contracting—common issues in Colorado’s climate.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        Oak, hickory, and maple are popular choices for their durability and ability to handle environmental changes. Engineered hardwood is constructed with multiple layers, providing extra stability, which is especially important in regions like Colorado where homes experience both hot summers and cold winters.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        To further protect your floors, it’s also important to maintain proper indoor humidity levels, ideally between 30% and 50%, and ensure proper subfloor preparation to avoid moisture issues. With the right wood species and professional installation, your hardwood floors will maintain their beauty and longevity, even in Colorado’s unique conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">

                    Will wood flooring increase the value of my home? <span class="faq-chevron"><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></span>

                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        Yes, wood flooring can significantly increase the value of your home. Homebuyers often view hardwood floors as a desirable, high-quality feature because of their timeless beauty, durability, and low maintenance. Compared to other types of flooring, hardwood is known to enhance both the aesthetic appeal and the overall resale value of a property.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        In fact, installing hardwood floors can yield a return on investment (ROI) of 70% to 80%, making it one of the most valuable home improvements you can make. Additionally, hardwood is durable and long-lasting, which means potential buyers won’t have to worry about replacing the flooring anytime soon. In markets like Denver, CO, where homes often experience fluctuating temperatures, engineered hardwood is especially popular for its resilience to climate changes, further boosting its appeal.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        Overall, upgrading to wood flooring not only enhances the look of your home but also makes it more attractive to future buyers, increasing both marketability and value.

                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        After wood flooring installation, proper maintenance is essential to ensure your floors remain beautiful and long-lasting. Regularly sweeping or vacuuming is important to remove dust and debris that can scratch the surface. Use a vacuum designed for hardwood floors or a soft-bristled broom to prevent damage. It's also crucial to avoid excess moisture, as too much water can cause warping or damage over time. Clean your floors with a damp mop using a cleaner specifically made for wood, and be sure to wipe up any spills immediately.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        To protect your floors from scratches, consider placing felt pads under furniture legs and using area rugs in high-traffic areas. Maintaining a stable indoor humidity level between 30% and 50% is also recommended, as wood naturally expands and contracts with changes in humidity. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        Over time, your hardwood floors may need refinishing to restore their original shine. Depending on wear and foot traffic, refinishing can be done every 7 to 10 years. By following these simple steps, your wood floors will continue to enhance your space for many years. If you need additional advice or assistance, we’re always here to help!

                    Can I install hardwood floors over an existing floor? <span class="faq-chevron"><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></span>

                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        Yes, you can install hardwood floors over an existing floor, but it depends on the type and condition of the current flooring. Engineered hardwood is often a better choice for this kind of installation because of its thinner profile and enhanced stability. It can be installed over materials like vinyl, tile, or concrete, as long as the subfloor is level, clean, and in good condition.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        For solid hardwood, installation over existing floors is possible but requires more preparation. The existing floor must be smooth, structurally sound, and moisture-free to avoid issues like warping or unevenness. In some cases, it's recommended to remove the old flooring or use a floating floor method for a better result.

                        The time it takes to install hardwood floors depends on several factors, including the size of the area, the type of hardwood, and the complexity of the installation. On average, a standard hardwood floor installation for a typical room (about 500 square feet) can take 2 to 5 days. This includes time for preparing the subfloor, laying the hardwood planks, and adding finishing touches like trim and moldings.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        If your project involves engineered hardwood, it may be quicker, as it’s easier to install and can sometimes be completed in 1 to 3 days. Solid hardwood installations might take longer, especially if additional steps like acclimation or refinishing are needed.

                    <p class="specific-paragraph">

                    What is the difference between solid hardwood and engineered wood flooring? <span class="faq-chevron"><i class="fa-solid fa-chevron-down"></i></span>
                </h5>
                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        The key difference between solid hardwood and engineered wood flooring lies in their construction. Solid hardwood is made from a single piece of natural wood, usually about ¾ inch thick, and can be sanded and refinished multiple times over its lifespan. It's highly durable and ideal for areas where moisture and humidity levels are stable.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        Engineered wood flooring, on the other hand, is composed of multiple layers. The top layer is real hardwood, while the underlying layers are made of plywood or high-density fiberboard. This layered construction makes engineered wood more resistant to changes in temperature and humidity, making it a great choice for areas like basements or homes in climates with more moisture variation, such as Denver, CO.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        While both options offer the beauty of real wood, solid hardwood is best for traditional installation methods, while engineered wood is more versatile and can be installed over concrete or radiant heating systems. If you need help deciding which option is best for your home, we’re happy to guide you!

                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        Choosing the right wood species for your flooring depends on several factors, including durability, style, and budget. Harder wood species like oak, hickory, and maple are excellent for high-traffic areas due to their durability and resistance to dents and scratches. If you want something more exotic or with unique grain patterns, species like walnut or cherry offer rich color and character but may be softer and require more maintenance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        Consider your home’s aesthetic when choosing wood. Oak offers a classic, versatile look, while walnut provides a darker, more sophisticated appearance. Additionally, think about your local climate—engineered hardwood made from durable species is often a better choice in areas with fluctuating humidity, like Colorado, because it’s more resistant to expansion and contraction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        Lastly, your budget may guide your decision, as some species are more affordable than others. If you need help finding the perfect balance between durability, style, and cost, we’re happy to guide you through the options!

                        Proper moisture control and subfloor preparation are critical steps to ensure a long-lasting hardwood floor installation. First, we assess the moisture levels in both the subfloor and the surrounding environment. Wood is sensitive to moisture, so we use a moisture meter to ensure the subfloor is within the ideal range (usually between 6% and 9%) to prevent issues like warping or buckling after installation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        Next, we thoroughly inspect the subfloor to ensure it's clean, level, and structurally sound. If necessary, we address any uneven areas by sanding, patching, or leveling the subfloor to create a stable foundation. For concrete subfloors or areas prone to moisture, we may apply a vapor barrier or use engineered hardwood, which is more resistant to moisture.
                    </p>
                    <p class="specific-paragraph">
                        By carefully managing moisture and ensuring the subfloor is properly prepared, we guarantee a durable, beautiful hardwood floor that will stand the test of time. If you have any concerns, feel free to ask—we’re here to make sure your floors are installed perfectly!
